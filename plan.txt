PART 1- DESIGN:

(python, numpy, mypy, pytest)

1. Present value approach
    1a: get the risk free rate - YTM of most similar maturity US treasury
    1b: try YTM intead of rfr
2. Stochastic calculus approach (CIR/ vasicek model)

Yield calculations? eg YTM

Inputs:
- maturity date
- interest rate
- face value
- payment frequency

Outputs:
- can return result from each approach
- clean and dirty bond prices
