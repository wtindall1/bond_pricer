PART 1- DESIGN:

(python, numpy, mypy, pytest)

1. Present value approach
    //1a: get the risk free rate - yield
2. Stochastic calculus approach 
    (model assumptions??)
    use vasicek model to forecast short term interest rates for each cash flow
    run multiple simulations and store bond price for each interest rate path
    then average the prices



Inputs:
- maturity date
- interest rate
- face value
- payment frequency

Outputs:
- can return result from each approach
- clean and dirty bond prices



PART 2: IMPLEMENTATION

FastAPI:
- post endpoint, returns dirty & clean price (& any calculated inputs / assumptions)
- posts request, response, dirty & clean prices in database

DB:
- postgres
- requests table (raw request & fields mapped out)
- responses table (raw response & fields mapped out)
